  <h1>What is Interaction Design?</h1>

  <p>Interaction design is all around us: it’s in the digital tools we use everyday; it’s on the web, it’s off the web; it’s at the tips of our fingers, it’s in our pockets; in short, it’s everywhere. Interaction design is about shaping digital things for people’s use.</p>

  <p>The emergence of devices like the iPhone and iPad have – in a very short space of time – revolutionised how we interact with and consume content. Tools like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are changing our behaviour. We browse web sites whilst watching television, or standing in a bus queue. Interaction designers shape these experiences.</p>

  <p>In the last few years the need for a new kind of designer has emerged, a designer with the skills and thinking required to design for these new platforms, and for platforms that have yet to be conceived.</p>

  <p>This design-centred course is aimed at those who aspire for a career as an interaction designer, helping to shape the digital landscape we all, increasingly, live in. The course equips you with the skills you need to meet the challenges of an industry that’s changing rapidly and which offers exciting international career opportunities.</p>
