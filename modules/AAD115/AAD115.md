AAD115 – Interaction Design Fundamentals
========================================

I'll be posting supporting material for AAD115 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, don't worry, Tim and Paul will be introducing you to its magic at the end of Week 02.

GitHub can all appear a little intimidating at first, but – like anything in life – with some experience it will all make sense. Don't worry, we won't leave you in the dark, we're here to help and will ensure you're all set to go. For now you can just keep this page bookmarked and read it like any other web page.


Week 01 – The Adventure Ahead
-----------------------------

In this, our first week, we welcomed you to our exciting adventure ahead. Our presentations were as follows:

+ The Adventure Ahead
+ A Show and Tell: Meet Messrs Potter and Murphy
+ Good Ideas Grow on Paper

We flagged up the [Refresh Belfast with Brendan Dawes](https://getinvited.to/refreshbelfast/refresh-with-brendan-dawes/), 20 October, for which you should all be getting a ticket. We also highlighted [Break](http://breakconf.org), for which we are sponsoring you, i.e. you get into Break 100% free, as our students. Yay!

Monday's session stressed the importance of working on paper:

> Paper should be the first point of call to get your idea(s)  out of your head and into a form that can be easily visualised, reimagined, discussed and shared.
> —Jake Giltsoff, Typekit

> [Always start on paper.](http://www.leemunroe.com/designing-with-pen-paper/)
> —Lee Munroe, Mailgun

> When we jump straight onto the computer and begin pushing pixels around in Photoshop (or our weapon of choice), we’re jumping several stages ahead in the process, without any of the foundational stages that go before it. As a result, we’ll likely find that problems arrive that would’ve been foreseen if we’d only gone through a bit of research and discovery first — some sketching, some loose ideas. The best designs come at the end of a process, and that process begins with rough experimentation with lo-fi tools.
> —Elliot Jay Stocks, Typekit

Next up we had a full day paper prototyping workshop.



Week 02 – Point
---------------

We're starting with the smallest possible building block – the point – we'll use this across a range of exercises on paper that investigate and explore form and composition.


Week 03 – Line
--------------

The line…


Week 04 – Plane
---------------

Something about planes… This week we'll explore tone, etc., we'll look at compositional approaches: the golden section, the law of thirds, etc., etc.


Week 05 – Typography
--------------------

The letter, the word, the sentence, the paragraph, the page: These are the building blocks of typography. This week we'll begin to explore typography, working from the letter to the page. We'll be covering the fundamentals of typography, content that will serve you well in your future careers.

In an excellent article titled [Web Design is 95% Typography](http://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/) iA's Oliver Reichenstein stated:

> 95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography.

Today we'll only uncover the tip of the typographic iceberg. The importance of typography can't be stressed enough, it is the backbone of almost everything we do. We'll be working through a series of staged exercises, as we have in previous weeks, but I'd strongly suggest you explore some of the content we've linked to below. Start with [Typekit Practice](http://practice.typekit.com), courtesy of Tim Brown and the folks at Typekit, it's a very good resource and is growing over time (indeed, I'm working on a little something – on numerals – for it, with Tim). 

I'd also strongly recommend that you get at least a couple of the books below. There are hundreds of books on typography, if you're just embarking on your journey I'd strongly recommend Erik Spiekermann's [Stop Stealing Sheep](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321934288/monographic-21), it's a very good primer. Ellen Lupton's [Thinking With Type](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568989695/monographic-21) is also excellent.

Week 06 – Colour
----------------

Notes will be uploaded here to align with our taught delivery on the Mondays and Tuesdays.



Week 07 – Your Home on the Web
------------------------------

Today we'll look at an introduction to HTML (HyperText Markup Language), by first taking a look back through the past 25 years of the world wide web, from it's humble beginnings in 1989, when inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee produced the original proposal for the web to what it has become today.

We'll cover web standards - what they are and why should you care, HTML Tags and page structure and HTML5, the latest spec to become a [W3C official standard](http://www.w3.org/).

###Resources

+ [Web at 25](http://www.webat25.org/)
+ [WaSP - Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org/)
+ [The Difference Between Block-level and Inline Elements](http://www.impressivewebs.com/difference-block-inline-css/)
+ [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)

###Practical Session

We'll work through a couple of exercises on Monday, including marking up a newspaper spread and a printed article on John Baskerville.

On Tuesday you'll use the HTML5 template and the John Baskerville plain text to create a HTML page guided by your choices you made on Monday. Link the finished HTML page from your AAD115 GitHub page, and if possible, take a photo of your marked up printed page and post it also.

__Practical Resources__
+ [HTML5 Template](resources/html5-template.html)
+ [John Baskerville Plain Text](resources/John-Baskerville.txt)



Week 08 – Break
---------------

This week we'll all be attending [Break](http://breakconf.org). Thanks to a very generous sponsorship partnership with Tim Brundle and the team at Innovation Ulster Ltd., we have tickets for you for the conference. You can access everything - except the Afternoon with Shopify (which is limited, due to space) - and we'd encourage you to go to as much as possible. This is a fantastic opportunity to meet with designers from all over the world and will, I hope, underline the wonderful position Belfast occupies on a world stage.

The [Dribbble Meetup](https://dribbble.com/meetups) on the Wednesday evening, which is being organised by the talented team at [Get Invited](https://getinvited.to), is an excellent opportunity to meet other like-minded designers. Even better there's a free bar and lots of lovely Dribbble schwag on offer.

If networking fills you with dread, have no fear, we'll have discussed it briefly in Week 05, just in time for your first Refresh Belfast. I'd also suggest you read Jessica Hische's excellent article
