AAD323/DES311 - Creative Entrepreneurship
==========================================

I'll be posting supporting material for AAD323 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, I'd suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for our supporting lecture content, we hope to ensure you're aware of it. Please watch this page. This will ensure you're kept up to date when the file changes (you'll be notified in your GitHub newsfeed when any changes are made).

Module Deliverables
-------------------

There are 2 pieces of coursework.

1. Digital Product Project Proposal (60%)
2. Reflective Journal (40%)

__Coursework 1 - Digital Product Project (60%)__

Each student will present a digital product project proposal - broken down into 3 componants:

+ Digital Product Project Proposal (slides)
+ Digital Product Project Presentation (viva)
+ Digital Product and Promotional Website

The proposal should clearly summarise the project idea, pitching it to a clearly defined potential audience and identifying an appropriate financial model for the product (e.g. Freemium, SaaS…). This proposal should also evidence reflection on the legal and professional issues underpinning the project, demonstrating an understanding of copyright investigation undertaken while branding the project. We’ll also expect to see the creation of your chosen digital product along with a promotional website

__Coursework 2 – Reflective Journal (40%)__

Supporting material, assessed throughout the semester as the project evolves, including: idea generation, market research and user personas (Week 4); product and website wireframes and prototypes (Week 8); and project proposals, including target audiences and pricing models (Week 12).


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

This week we'll introduce the teaching staff and an overview of the module. We'll introduce the deliverables, what is research and experimentation and look at exemplar examples from previous years.

###Labs

There are no labs this week. Labs will commence in Week 2.

Week 02 - From Service to Product
---------------------------------

__PLEASE NOTE__: Due to an event in the Conor Lecture theatre, next week’s lecture will take place in __82A01/82A02__. This room is located on the ground floor, beside the security desk at the main entrance.

This week we'll explore how designers are increasingly moving from the delivery of services, towards products.
During the lecture we'll look at the evolution of ‘digital product design’ and how many designers are starting to use their skills to develop product ranges, for example: icons, prints, themes, and other forms of product.

###Labs

This week we expect to see evidence of initial idea generation and market research. We expect to see you undertaking the groundwork that will form the basis of the project as we progress through the semester. When thinking of an idea for your digital product project you may start by considering the following questions:

+ What currently exists?
+ What problem are you solving?
+ Is there a market for it?
+ Who is the market?
+ How much could I charge or would I make it free?
+ Would it sell?

Please post this research in Week 2 of your [Design Journal](resources/DES311_Design_Journal.zip).
