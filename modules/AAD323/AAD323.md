AAD323/DES311 - Creative Entrepreneurship
==========================================

I'll be posting supporting material for AAD323 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, I'd suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for our supporting lecture content, we hope to ensure you're aware of it. Please watch this page. This will ensure you're kept up to date when the file changes (you'll be notified in your GitHub newsfeed when any changes are made).

Module Deliverables
-------------------

There are 2 pieces of coursework.

1. Digital Product Project Proposal (60%)
2. Reflective Journal (40%)

__Coursework 1 - Digital Product Project (60%)__

Each student will present a digital product project proposal - broken down into 3 componants:

+ Digital Product Project Proposal (slides)
+ Digital Product Project Presentation (viva)
+ Digital Product and Promotional Website

The proposal should clearly summarise the project idea, pitching it to a clearly defined potential audience and identifying an appropriate financial model for the product (e.g. Freemium, SaaS…). This proposal should also evidence reflection on the legal and professional issues underpinning the project, demonstrating an understanding of copyright investigation undertaken while branding the project. We’ll also expect to see the creation of your chosen digital product along with a promotional website

__Coursework 2 – Reflective Journal (40%)__

Supporting material, assessed throughout the semester as the project evolves, including: idea generation, market research and user personas (Week 4); product and website wireframes and prototypes (Week 8); and project proposals, including target audiences and pricing models (Week 12).
