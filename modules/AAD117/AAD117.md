AAD117 - Exploring Identity
===========================

Exploring aspects of iconography, branding, and visual identity, this practice-based module investigates how design considers issues of character and personality and how these can be communicated graphically.

Week 01 - Monograms and Personal Identity
-----------------------------------------

This week we introduced monograms, looking at what a monogram is and a case study of well known monograms and resources. We also explored personal identity, through personality tests to find out a little bit more about yourself and how persoanlity can be applied visually. 

Your first week task is to sketch out as many variations of your initials as you can on paper, based on your new found knowledge of monograms and your exploration of personal identity and its visual application.

Week 02 - Monogram Development
------------------------------

This week we'd like you to pick your favourite monogram identity and develop it onscreen using Sketch. You'll also be able to explore colour, thinking back to your personality type and which colour best fits you.
