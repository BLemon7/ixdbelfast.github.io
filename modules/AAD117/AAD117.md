Week 01 - Monograms and Personal Identity
-----------------------------------------

This week we introduced monograms, looking at what a monogram is and a case study of well known monograms and resources. We also explored personal identity, through personality tests to find out a little bit more about yourself and how personality can be applied visually. 

Your first week task is to sketch out as many variations of your initials as you can on paper, based on your new found knowledge of monograms and your exploration of personal identity and its visual application.

Week 02 - Monogram Development
------------------------------

This week we'd like you to pick your favourite monogram identity and develop it onscreen using Sketch. You'll also be able to explore colour, thinking back to your personality type and which colour best fits you. 

Week 03 - Wordmarks and Kerning
-------------------------------

This week we introduced wordmarks, looking at what they are with examples of both corporate and personal wordmarks. We also looked at kerning, what it is, examples of good and bad kerning in the wild. We also introduced kerning for the web, looking at the different methods available to us today, to control our web typography.

Your task this week is to sketch out your name as a wordmark. Find a style that resonates with you and is complimentary to your chosen monogram. Look at them both as part of the same identity not separate entities.

You'll also work through kerning for the web in the afternoon session, learning how to kern web typography with the various methods available to us, and learn the advantages and disadvantages of each to better aid your judgement of which method is suitable for the task at hand.

###Staff Changes

Week 10 - Style Tiles, Pattern Libraries and Brand Guidelines
-------------------------------------------------------------

###Style Tiles
When you provide detailed mockups of a website, app or digital publication you can easily imply that you’re executing the final design. Clients can quickly get confused and feel disconnected from the design process. This can give them a false sense of completion, detaching them from the final solution. 

Managing your clients expectations and involving them in the development of the deliverables will make them feel a more active part of the whole process and help buy-in along the way.

The creation of a series of [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es) at the early stage of the design process can help define the general visual approach of the project and, unlike website mockups, are relatively easy and quick to create.

Working specifically with text, [Typecast](http://typecast.com) is an excellent way to quickly prototype the typographic layout of your website. Sign up for a free account as soon as you can.

###Pattern Libraries
Pattern Libraries such as those created by [MailChimp](http://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns), have become an essential asset for many of today’s major organiations. They can help ensure consistency in user experience, allow for reusability of frequently used elements and help make site maintenance a much easier process.
