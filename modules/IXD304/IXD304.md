IXD304 Creative Entrepreneurship
================================

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

###Week 01 An Introduction to Entrepreneurship

I will add more content here when I get a moment but in the meantime please find some of the resources we covered at today’s lecture…

####Learn from the Professionals    
The keyword here is *learn*. Look, but don’t copy, therein lies the road to a *lot* of trouble. We will look at issues around copyright and plagiarism in **Week 06 – Who Owns What** but in the meantime, feel free to draw inspiration from the resources you find but make sure your website is exactly that. 100% yours.

We looked at:

- [Personal Page by Naz Hamid](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page)   
- [Fieldwork](http://madebyfieldwork.com) and
- [Marco Grimaldi](http://www.thenerodesign.com)

Importantly find your own inspiration and preferably from places other than **One Page Love** or **Awwwards**. These sites, and lots like them, can be useful, but your site will just end up a clone of everyone elses. This is your time to shine.

The [net awards](https://thenetawards.com/vote) is a great place to find real talent. Where categories such as [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer) and [Young Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer) celebrate the next generation of talent. Who knows, some of you could be here in time to come!
