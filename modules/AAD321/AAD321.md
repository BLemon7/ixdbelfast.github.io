AAD321/DES310 - Narrative and Storytelling
===================================

I'll be posting supporting material for AAD321 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, I'd suggest you educate yourself. You should all be learning about version control and, by using GitHub for our supporting lecture content, we hope to ensure you're aware of it.

Please watch this page. This will ensure you're kept up to date when the file changes (you'll be notified in your GitHub newsfeed when any changes are made).

Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

This week we'll introduce the teaching staff and an overview of the module. We'll introduce the deliverables, what is research and experimentation and look at exemplar examples from previous years.

This week we'll introduce Narrative Architecture. Well explore different types of narrative experiences including Enacted and Emergent narratives, what they are and why do they matter?

###Labs

This week we'll take you through getting your Design Journal setup, should you be having any issues. Please download the design journal (see week one above for link) and get it setup on your Student workspace e.g.

```

```

We'd like to to markup the raw bird text file you have been given using Markdown. Save a copy of your Markdown file and link it in Week 2 of your Design Journal.

You may want to take some time to read the Markdown basics. To help we've included some resources below.

This week we'll think about experience and what things are like. What happens when we turn the page of a magazine? How do we move through states?


Week 08 – Break
---------------

This week staff are running Break conference. Students will be encouraged to attend Break and/or related events.


Week 09 – Group Critique
------------------------

This week is a group critique where specific feedback will be given highlighting exemplary work and denoting potential areas of improvement to enable students to revise project work prior to final submission.


Week 10 – Learning from Film/Music
----------------------------------

This week we'll explore what we can learn from other types of media to gain a deeper understanding of storytelling. We'll look at examples from the world of film and music to highlight the narrative experience.


Week 11 – Storytelling (Presentation Skills)
