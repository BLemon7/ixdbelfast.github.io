Imaging and Data Visualisation
==============================


###Module Hand-in

All work has to be completed and online by **noon on Friday 8th May 2015**.
Make sure your work is easy to find and any external links are well marked. If we can't find links to Flickr, Tumblr, etc we will not be able to mark it.

***

###Introduction

We’ve been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce students to photographic, illustrative and diagrammatic approaches to communication. Showcasing the power of the image in communication the module equips students with the ability to not only create images, but also brief others’ on how to create images, through the creation of functional mood boards.

More details on the module can be found at [Imaging and Data Visualisation](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/02/02/imaging-and-data-visualisation.html) on the IxD website

As mentioned, you will have three projects this semester

- **Coursework 1 – Photographic Pool (25%, hand-in Week 3, Wednesday 18th February)**
- **Coursework 2 – Illustrative Pool (25%, hand-in Week 6, Wednesday 18th March)** 
- **Coursework 3 – Diagrammatic Pool (50%, hand-in Week 12, Wednesday 29th April)**
- **Final hand-in of all project and coursework Wednesday 6th May 2015**

Feedback will be provided on Weeks 4, 8 and 12, this will you the chance to reflect on your work and, if necessary, revist your work before the final hand-in in week 12.

Each project will be assessed by:

- **Depth and breadth of research** – to ensure the success of any project either here or in the future thorough research should be the very first thing you consider before starting on to the creative side of the project. The more you understand about what is being asked of you the better equipped you will be to fulfil the requirements.

- **Creative experimentation and prototyping** – this is always a vital part of your project submission and so many people lose out on easy marks by not including their background work, sketches, rejected ideas and so on. This shows that you have tried a number of different approaches before your final submission and not just gone with the first idea that pops into your head. 

- **Confidence of final solution** – have you pushed yourself creatively or played it safe? Trying new approaches that you may not have tackled before will help you develop as a designer don't play it safe, push yourself. How you present your final pieces is very important, you want to show them off to the best of their ability so make sure everything is in focus and as clean as possible.


Week 01 – The Impact of Photography
-----------------------------------

**Apologies for the equipment failure this morning and its subsequent impact on the lecture delivery.** 

To get things on an even track I have included a lot of material that will be useful for your first project for this module.

###Research resources

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all aspiring designers need to master. While many designers commission photographers to take the images they need for any given project, on occasions a clients budget simply doesn’t stretch to allow for this additional expense. 

This is when having the ability to take your own photographs can become a big asset. Not only can you charge for the service, it can also give you the edge over other designers who don't have these skills.

I have retained a page on (currently under reconstruction) [pixelpaper.org](http://www.pixelpaper.org/photography.php) that will cover some of what I went through on Friday.

The [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net) website is an excellent resource for kicking your research off. And don’t just pick a few photographers from the first list of names you come across. Take a look through a number and choose those whose work particularly inspire you.

There are obviously other sources which you should (or rather must) research. The following are a few other notable sites worth checking out. Please do research your own too.

[National Geographic Photography](http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography)

[Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com)

Instagram is hugely popular and you will find plenty of professional photographers to follow there. [Dan Rubin](http://instagram.com/danrubin) shoots on nothing but the iPhone here so do check him out to see what id possible with a smartphone.

Also worth taking a look at for inspiration is [unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

###Extra Classes

[Skillshare](http://www.skillshare.com/?via=header) is an excellent online service for all manner of creative upskilling some will cost a nominal fee while others are free. Coincidently [Street Photography: Capture the Life of Your City](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Street-Photography-Capture-the-Life-of-Your-City/88669495?discount=VSCO&teacherRef=7890085&utm_source=Skillshare&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_term=class-trashhand&utm_content=free-members&utm_campaign=2015-01-27-vsco-trashhand-announcement&via=newsletter) is currently available and worth checking out plus it's free.

Other, notable classes are:

- [Mobile Photography: Capturing Friends and New Perspectives](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Mobile-Photography-Capturing-Friends-and-New-Perspectives/830436227?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [Mobile Post-Production: Editing Your Photos](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Mobile-Post-Production-Editing-Your-Photos/1195481754?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [The Possibilities of Instagram: Sharing Your Best Photos](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/The-Possibilities-of-Instagram-Sharing-Your-Best-Photos/2016308536?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [Cityscape Photography: Capture Your City's Story](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Cityscape-Photography-Capture-Your-Citys-Story/62903648?via=browse-popular-photography)

These do require that you sign up for Skillshare's premium membership but you can sign up for a month and cancel it after that if you wish. At $9.96 (around £6/7) you could pack a lot of online classes in over the month.


###Project 01
**Macro**

- Study a piece of architecture and photograph it from different viewpoints 

- You should aim to take on board the principles we will cover and you have researched into consideration. 

- Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

- All of your images should be uploaded to your Flickr account with a clear link from your Design Journal to the set.

- Consider the story behind the images, what are you trying to say to the viewer?

**Micro**

- Photograph a series of small, individual details from the building you photographed.

- Consider how these items are photographed, retain a consistency in your approach.

- Follow the same guidelines as those for the Macro series.

- Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

>“For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.” Henri Cartier-Bresson

We are not trying to turn you into photographers. We simply want to raise your awareness of good imagery and it’s impact in good design. It will add another skill to your creative arsenal. At the very least you should get into the habit of gathering visual material with your camera or smartphone.

You don't need to buy a camera but if you want to research what's available, ask advice from the experts and check the reviews. {Ken Rockwell](http://kenrockwell.com) runs a website offering advice on the best cameras and equipment to go for, he tends to focus on Nikon's and Canon's so his outlook is a little limited but still worth checking out.

###Get Flickr!

If you don't already have one you need to get yourself a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) account to upload your project work to this semester. It will get you into the habit of using public creative platforms and provide another area to show off that creative spark.

As mentioned, Richard Weston's [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170) stream is worth checking out. Go to Albums and take a look at [Surface and Object](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157601280958287), [Experimentals](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157630663339086) and [The Ulster Museum](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157623516856557) for a little inspiration.

Week 02 – Harmony and Proportion
--------------------------------

**I do not want to see Instagram used as the final method of delivery and image creation (filters) for your final 12 images.** You can use Instagram as a means to show some experimental material but nothing more.

Material on Henri Cartier-Bresson can be found at:

- [Foundation Henri Cartier-Bresson](http://www.henricartierbresson.org/index_en.htm)
- [Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&ERID=24KL53ZMYN)
- [10 Things Henri Cartier-Bresson Can Teach You About Street Photography](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2011/08/22/10-things-henri-cartier-bresson-can-teach-you-about-street-photography)

Everyone is an expert, or so some think. In 2006 Flickr user [André Rabelo][17] submitted Henri Cartier-Bresson's worldfamous photograph, [Hyeres, France; 1932][18] to the Flickr group pool [Delete Me](http://petapixel.com/2011/07/13/why-you-shouldnt-give-too-much-weight-to-anonymous-online-critics). The group reviews submitted photographs deciding whether they are good enough to stay on the site. Cartier-Bresson's timeless classic was deleted very quickly. 

This goes to prove that you shouldn't place too much emphasis on feedback from people who obviously don't know what they are talking about!

We looked also at [Aleksandr Rodchenko](http://aleksandrodchenko.wordpress.com) and the Constructivists last semester but it is always worthwhile reviewing them again. As I have mentioned before,  a solid understanding of design (and art) history will go a long, long way to enrich you as a designer. You can find some of Rodchenko's photographs on [Photoforager](http://www.photoforager.com/archives/alexander-rodchenko).

We looked briefly at James Webb Young's [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071410945/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071410945&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21) last year, it's a very valuable read and costing less than the price of a pint you would be foolish not to get it. 

Webb Young looks at advertising as the focus for idea generation, but the messages can be applied to any creative process and if adhered to will remain with you for life. 

###Preparing images for screen and web

This piece from Six Revisions [The Comprehensive Guide to Saving Images for the Web](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/comprehensive-guide-saving-images-for-web/) will take you through the necessary steps to ensure your images are properly prepared for presentation on the web.

Photoshop isn't the final step in this process. You can use a number of online tools and apps that will reduce your file size further making sure you website is as lean as possible.

Week 03 – Manufactured Fictions in The Age of Instagram
-------------------------------------------------------

>"We shape our tools and there after our tools shape us."

This quote from Marshall McLuan is now more relevant than ever. Mobile technology is everywhere, anyone with a smartphone can become photographers, [journalists,][13] cinematographers, all thanks to the incredible technology we carry with us.

####The Nostalgia of Now

The age of the film camera is more-or-less behind us, with single function, digital cameras, now not far behind. The age of smartphone photography is well and truly here with apps such as [Hipstamatic][2] and [Instagram][3] helping turn the mediocre into the sublime.

[2]:http://hipstamatic.com
[3]:http://instagram.com

With a multitude of filtered effects these apps, and similar others, allow us to make photographs taken today look as if they were shot decades ago. The effects can help create moods and atmospheres, developing personalities and creating a visual brand for individuals and groups. 

Scottish electronic music duo [Boards of Canada][4] use filtered images to evoke memories of hazy summer days. Colours are bleached or saturated, blurred and tinted, giving the impression they were shot decades ago, left in a dusty drawer to gracefully degrade.

Their visual approach matches the music beautifully, snippits of 1970s media are layered with analogue and electronic instruments creating a warm timeless nostalgic wash of sound.

In contrast [Tom Waits][5] has developed a visual persona that matches his gravelly voice and musical themes of degradation and dereliction. [Matt Mahurin's][6] photographs for Waits' [Mule Variations][7] album matches the music beautifully. The sepia-toned grainy images are reminiscent of portraits from the earliest days of photography while videos such as this for [Hold On][8] takes the style into the world of the moving image.

####Beyond the screen

Smartphone photography is finding its way increasingly into mainstream media. [Nick Laham's][9] Instagram iPhone photographs of the [New York Yankees][10] can now be licensed from [Getty Images.][11] 

When on location in Afghanistan, New York Times staff photographer [Damon Winter][12] used his iPhone to capture images of American troops.

>“Composing with the iPhone is more casual and less deliberate, and the soldiers often take photos of each other with their phones, so they were more comfortable than if I had my regular camera.”

The grainy, colour saturated effects added by Hipstamatic's filters bring a reality to the images no DSLR could hope to achieve.

The ability to record moments in time is now easier than ever, we can shoot stills or HD video and instantly share them with friends, family, the rest of the world. While Instagram seeks to reach the masses for the quick gratification of seeing your image liked by complete strangers, other sites such as [Pictory][14] ask us to look a little more closely at, very often, the deeply personal story behind the image.

In preparation for next weeks feedback session review your photographs and reshoot any you feel don't fit the brief. You may use Photoshop or Lightroom or any other preferred photo editing tool to tidy up your images. Do not over do it, these tools should only be used to crop your images if necessary, adjust the exposure, brightness and contrast and if necessary add or remove a little saturation. There are numerous Photoshop tutorials online these [Photoshop essentials][18] may be useful.

If you haven't tried Instagram or Hipstamatic give them a go and post the results on your Design Journal.

Week 04 – The Art of Art Direction
==================================

This week we had guest lecturer, [Richard Weston],(http://www.designishistory.com/1920/jan-tschichold) introducing art direction.

Art directors often begin their careers as designers, or illustrators or photographers. Art directors are generally good at seeing the 'bigger picture'. Where a designer may focus on what looks right for a project an art director will look for what *feels* right.

Typographer, [Jan Tschichold](http://www.designishistory.com/1920/jan-tschichold) talked about design as:

>“A principle of identity between content and expression.” 

While art direction was not perceived as a discipline when Tschichold was practicing, this quote perfectly sums up what we now see as its role.

[Josef Müller-Brocmann](http://www.typetoken.net/icon/josef-muller-brockmann-lars-muller-publishers-poster-collection-25) was a great designer and art director orchestrating the photography and typography of his posters to precise effect.

Book cover designer and art director [Coralie Bickford-Smith](http://cb-smith.com) uses the power of art direction to stunning effect.

Art direction does not need to be a complex process, it can indeed be very simple. The act of choosing a filter in Instagram is an act of art direction, the choice of filter very often will change the mood of an image, altering the viewers perception of what the image is saying. The effects in this case are the tools the art director uses to deliver the feeling he or she is looking for.

Art direction encompasses all aspects of design, in simple terms it could be about the choice of an appropriate typeface or colour for a food packaging or it can influence the direction of the opening titles to a movie.

[Tilden Freeman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Tilden), Interpretive Designer summed up one meaning of art direction

>"The chief aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation."

Movie title sequences are an excellent example of art direction in action. In many ways they set the mood of the movie, building anticipation. Some excellent examples include:

- Saul Bass’ [Vertigo](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/vertigo)
- Kyle Cooper’s [Se7en](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/se7en) – there is an excellent overview of the processes behind the making of this sequence. 
- Zack Snyder’s [Watchmen](http://io9.com/5167732/easter-eggs-and-missing-parts-in-watchmens-titles)
- Richard Kenworthy’s [Scott Pilgrim](http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world) and
- Geefwee Boedoe’s [Monsters Inc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GXmdUL3BDQ) his website is worth checking out too.

###Displaying your photographs

I see that some people are already using sliding galleries to display their images. As someone who has wrestled with these in the past I would recommend taking a look at [ResponsiveSlides](http://responsiveslides.com) as a very simple means to create a rolling gallery for your images. A walkthrough for this is available on the website and you can download everything you need from GitHub [viljamis/ResponsiveSlides.js](viljamis/ResponsiveSlides.js).


###Project 02

####Design a series of three book covers

Choose ONE genre from the list below and research the subject. 

- Horror
- Romance
- Crime & thrillers
- Science Fiction & fantasy
- Children's classics
- Alternatively, you could choose one author and look at a range of their books

You might want to try to keep the books you choose around the same time frame. So if you choose say Horror, go with a series of classics: Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. 

Research the subject exhaustively before you put pen/pencil to paper. 

**Ideally read the books.**

After you have researched the subject we want you to create at least **three cover designs**. You can produce more if you wish and include designs for the spine and back if you feel the urge.

You don’t have to be a great artist to achieve great results on this project.

It's all about capturing the idea core to the narrative, it really doesn't matter exactly how that is done, as long as the concept it good and the execution has been well presented. Consider how they might appear on Amazon or iBooks and how the idea can be delivered through such a small image.

You can use illustration or collage or paper cuts or photography. Maybe even typography? Your finished pieces can be created by hand or on computer or a combination of both. It's up to you.

**Hand-in for this project is Week 6, Wednesday 18th March 2015.** We will then take a look through a selection of your work on Friday 20th March.

Week 05 – Illustration, Hand to Mouse
=====================================


**Don't forget to book your ticket to see [Mr Bingo](http://refreshbelfast.com) on Monday 9th March**


We covered a lot of illustrators and designers during today's lecture take a look through the list of names below and reflect on some of those mentioned. Make sure you include some of your own influences in your design diary too.

- [Martin O'Neill](http://cutitout.co.uk)
- [Kate Gibb](http://kategibb.co.uk)
- [Justin Van Genderen](http://www.2046design.com)

#####Home Grown Talent

Northern Ireland is coming down with creative talent, the following are a small collection of what's available, see how many others you can find.

- [P.J.Lynch](http://pjlynchgallery.blogspot.co.uk)
- [Nigel Peake](http://www.nigelpeake.com)
- [Oliver Jeffers](http://www.oliverjeffers.com)
- [Peter Strain](http://www.peterstrain.co.uk)
- [Jonathan McHugh](http://beepencil.com)

Finishing off with a couple of (the many successful) IMD graduates…

- [Jordan Henderson](http://blog.taleandteller.com)
- [Paddy Donnelly](http://lefft.com) check out his earlier [Blog entries](http://iampaddy.com/lifebelow600) to see how his work developed.
Richard looked at a number of different illustrators, designers and techniques that covered a wide range of approaches to cover design. 

[Penguin books][20] are the perfect vehicle for illustrating how a idea can be carried across a number of different outputs. The range of covers covered this week focussed on the concept and its execution which is core to any creative output. 

- [Alan Aldridge][26] this Wikipedia entry doesn't carry a lot of information (his own website isn't working at the moment) but you can also see a range of his work on his [Debut Art][26] space. 
- [Paul Hogarth][22] created numerous covers for Penguin including the excellent [Shakespeare Series][32]
- [David Gentleman][23] a very prolific illustrator, his work can also be seen on the walls of the London Underground at [Charing Cross][25] 
- [Coralie Bickford Smith][24] has designed a number of excellent series for Penguin from [Gothic Horror][30] to [Great Food.][31]

Also worth looking at are:

- [Jillian Tamaki's][27] covers for the [Penguin Threads][28] series
- [Sanda Zahirovic's][29] excellent science fiction series for Orion Publishing

Over the next couple of weeks we will look at a wider range of illustrators and techniques and the importance and application of art direction in the development and execution of concepts.

Week 06
=======

Due to personal circumstances this weeks lecture had to be cancelled. 

Week 07 – Ulster Festival of Art and Design
===========================================

This weeks lecture has been replaced by the [Ulster Festival of Art and Design](http://www.ulsterfestival.com)

Week 08 – Information Design and Visual Storytelling
====================================================

###Project 03 – Infographic / Data Visualisation

For your third and final project of the module we want you to create an infographic / data visualisation looking specifically at global population. Research the subject of data visualisation and infographics thoroughly before you start your own piece only then will you understand what needs done.

####Useful Resources

**The following link will provide you with the data you need to create your project - [worldometers](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population)**

Don't feel you need to just stick to this site for information, you may need to spread your research further to gather all of the data you need to create your final piece.

What you include in your visualisation is up to you but bear in mind that this will make up 50% of your final module mark so it needs to be a substantial body of work. A few graphs and pie charts will not be enough.

Your infographic/visualisation could focus on the historical and future changes in population, geographical, economic, religious differences, it's up to you.

At this stage research the subject as much as you can to investigate different approaches to data visualisation.

A few contemporary visualisations worth checking out are:

- [tweetping.net](http://tweetping.net)
- [How Different Groups Spend Their Day](www.nytimes.com//interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?hp)
- [The New York Times Innovation Portfolio](innovate.whsites.net)

Another look at [Christoph Niemann](http://www.gestalten.tv/motion/christoph-niemann) provided a number of different perspectives on approaches to client briefs. 

From the first marks on cave walls 40,000 years ago to the delivery of complex data in [theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-visualisation) today, we have been making sense of the world around us for millennia.

The Sumerians, Eqyptians, Mayans, Chinese and many other ancient cultures communicated through pictographic and logographic systems which grew and evolved into the modern written languages we use today. 

Pictographic systems are still widely used to helping us communicate on a global scale. Airport signage systems are a perfect example where pictographs have to communicate to a diverse range of cultures. 

Austrian socialist, [Otto Neurath](http://www.aiga.org/neurath-bliss-and-the-language-of-the-pictogram) developed a visual language of pictograms which he used to make sense of complex issues. Neurath along with [Gerd Arntz](http://www.gerdarntz.org) developed the International System of TYpographic Picture Education or [Isotype](http://www.designhistory.org/Symbols_pages/isotype.html).

These became the foundations for the development of pictographic systems which have to work daily for a worldwide audience. Examples include road signage, airport directional systems and classics such as those created for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich by [Ulm School of Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm_School_of_Design) co-founder [Otl Aicher](http://1972municholympics.co.uk/otl_aicher.php)

Nest week we will look specifically at a number of the key figures involved in infographics and data visualisation to give you a broader view of what is possible.

Week 09 – The Visual Language of Data
=====================================




As we saw according to IBM, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day, in fact so much now that 90% of the data in the world at present has been created in the last two years alone. 

Looking at a number of contemporary approaches to visualising data we focussed on a few key figures who are masters in this area.

[Martin Wattenberg](http://www.bewitched.com) is a computer scientist, artist and co-leader, with Fernanda Viégas, of Google's "Big Picture" data visualisation group.

In [Stefanie Posavec’s](http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk) own words “I tend to work with data projects that involve language, literature, or science (or all of these at once). Many of these projects represent data using a hand-crafted approach. Besides data visualisation/illustration/art, I occasionally design books.”

David McCandless is an author, data-journalist and information designer who works in print, web and television. His website [Information is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net) explores a multitude of information sets, reinterpreting very complex data and presenting in ways that make the content very accessible.

[Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com) has a very distinctive style which grew from a personal project, the Feltron Annual Report. [Daytum](http://daytum.com), created by Felton allows users to gather their own data and see it visualised.

Week 10 – Jonny Campbell 
========================

This weeks lecture was hosted by [Jonny Campbell](http://jonnycampbell.com) creative lead at [Brewbot](http://www.brewbot.io).

Week 11 – Designing and Deceiving with Data
===========================================

####Women Who Code Hackathon
As mentioned [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com) will be running a [Belfast Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/women-who-code-belfast-hackathon-tickets-16278544565) in the Belfast Campus on the 6th June 2015. They are looking for people of all levels with lunch and dinner included it promises to be a very informative day.

[Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte) is one of the founding fathers of information graphics and data visualisation. 

Author of a number of publications on information design his most notable books are:
- [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392142/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392142&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21)
- [Envisioning Information](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392118/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392118&linkCode=as2&tag=eleventhirty-21)
- [Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0961392126/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0961392126&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21)

Critical of PowerPoint’s use as a guidance rather than enlightening tool Tufte focussed on the way PowerPoint was used by NASA engineers in the events leading up to the 2003 [Space Shuttle Columbia disaster](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB). The software is designed to persuade rather than inform, burying information details in crowded slides using bullets points with tiny type. The result for Columbia was catastrophic. 

A similar lack of clarity in the presentation of vital data before the launch of the 1986 [Challenger Space Shuttle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster) resulted in another disaster. Information on the effect of low temperatures on O-ring integrity on the booster rockets was overlooked, the launch was given the go ahead, one of the rockets developed a leak, exploded, and all seven crew members tragically died.

Tufte coined the term ‘chartjunk’ referring to displays of information that are either non-informative or obscure the information it is meant to present.

>Sometimes decorations can help editorialize about the substance of the graphic. But it's wrong to distort the data measures—the ink locating values of numbers—in order to make an editorial comment or fit a decorative scheme.

He also invented what he called [Sparklines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline), which are very small line charts drawn without axes and coordinates used to present the general shape of variation in forms of measurement within a small space.

Unfortunately the information presented on the [Fukushima Nuclear Accident Infographic](https://infogr.am/fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-disaster) has been removed but the link presented here covers the reasonably well.
