Imaging and Data Visualisation
==============================

###Introduction


We’ve been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce students to photographic, illustrative and diagrammatic approaches to communication. Showcasing the power of the image in communication the module equips students with the ability to not only create images, but also brief others’ on how to create images, through the creation of functional mood boards.

More details on the module can be found at [Imaging and Data Visualisation](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/02/02/imaging-and-data-visualisation.html) on the IxD website

As mentioned, you will have three projects this semester

- **Coursework 1 – Photographic Pool (25%, hand-in Week 3, Friday 13th February)**
- **Coursework 2 – Illustrative Pool (25%, hand-in Week 6, Friday 6th March)** 
- **Coursework 3 – Diagrammatic Pool (50%, hand-in Week 12, Friday 6th May)**

Feedback will be provided on Weeks 4, 7 and 12, this will you the chance to reflect on your work and, if necessary, revist your work before the final hand-in in week 12.

Each project will be assessed by:

- **Depth and breadth of research** – to ensure the success of any project either here or in the future thorough research should be the very first thing you consider before starting on to the creative side of the project. The more you understand about what is being asked of you the better equipped you will be to fulfil the requirements.

- **Creative experimentation and prototyping** – this is always a vital part of your project submision and so many people lose out on easy marks by not including ther background work, sketches, rejected ideas and so on. This shows that you have tried a number of different aproaches before your final submission and not just gone with the first idea that pops into your head. 

- **Confidence of final solution** – have you pushed yourself creatively or played it safe? Trying new approaches that you may not have tackled before will help you develop as a designer dont play it safe, push yourself. How you present your final pieces is very important, you want to show them off to the best of their ability so make sure everything is in focus and as clean as possible.


Week 01 – The Impact of Photography
-----------------------------------

**Apologies for the equipment failure this morning and its subsequent impact on the lecture delivery.** 

To get things on an even track I have included a lot of material that will be useful for your first project for this module.

###Research resources

Knowing when, how and where to use images in your work is an essential tool all aspiring designers need to master. While many designers commission photographers to take the images they need for any given project, on occasions a clients budget simply doesn’t stretch to allow for this additional expense. 

This is when having the ability to take your own photographs can become a big asset. Not only can you charge for the service, it can also give you the edge over other designers who don't have these skills.

I have retained a page on (currently under reconstruction) [pixelpaper.org](http://www.pixelpaper.org/photography.php) that will cover some of what I went through on Friday.

The [Photography Now](http://photography-now.net) website is an excellent resource for kicking your research off. And don’t just pick a few photographers from the first list of names you come across. Take a look through a number and choose those whose work particularly inspire you.

There are obviously other sources which you should (or rather must) research. The following are a few other notable sites worth checking out. Please do research your own too.

[National Geographic Photography](http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography)

[Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com)

Instagram is hugely popular and you will find plenty of professional photographers to follow there. [Dan Rubin](http://instagram.com/danrubin) shoots on nothing but the iPhone here so do check him out to see what id possible with a smartphone.

Also worth taking a look at for inspiration is [unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

###Extra Classes

[Skillshare](http://www.skillshare.com/?via=header) is an excellent online service for all manner of creative upskilling some will cost a nominal fee while others are free. Coincidently [Street Photography: Capture the Life of Your City](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Street-Photography-Capture-the-Life-of-Your-City/88669495?discount=VSCO&teacherRef=7890085&utm_source=Skillshare&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_term=class-trashhand&utm_content=free-members&utm_campaign=2015-01-27-vsco-trashhand-announcement&via=newsletter) is currently available and worth checking out plus it's free.

Other, notable classes are:

- [Mobile Photography: Capturing Friends and New Perspectives](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Mobile-Photography-Capturing-Friends-and-New-Perspectives/830436227?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [Mobile Post-Production: Editing Your Photos](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Mobile-Post-Production-Editing-Your-Photos/1195481754?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [The Possibilities of Instagram: Sharing Your Best Photos](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/The-Possibilities-of-Instagram-Sharing-Your-Best-Photos/2016308536?via=browse-popular-photography)

- [Cityscape Photography: Capture Your City's Story](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/photography/Cityscape-Photography-Capture-Your-Citys-Story/62903648?via=browse-popular-photography)

These do require that you sign up for Skillshare's premium membership but you can sign up for a month and cancel it after that if you wish. At $9.96 (around £6/7) you could pack a lot of online classes in over the month.


###Project 01
**Macro**

- Study a piece of architecture and photograph it from different viewpoints 

- You should aim to take on board the principles we will cover and you have researched into consideration. 

- Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

- All of your images should be uploaded to your Flickr account with a clear link from your Design Journal to the set.

- Consider the story behind the images, what are you trying to say to the viewer?

**Micro**

- Photograph a series of small, individual details from the building you photographed.

- Consider how these items are photographed, retain a consistency in your approach.

- Follow the same guidelines as those for the Macro series.

- Six of the best will be presented in your Design Journal.

>“For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity.” Henri Cartier-Bresson

We are not trying to turn you into photographers. We simply want to raise your awareness of good imagery and it’s impact in good design. It will add another skill to your creative arsenal. At the very least you should get into tyhe habit of gathering visual material with your camera or smartphone.

You don't need to buy a camera but if you want to research what's available, ask advice from the experts and check the reviews. {Ken Rockwell](http://kenrockwell.com) runs a website offering advice on the best cameras and equipment to go for, he tends to focus on Nikons and Canons so his outlook is a little limited but still worth checking out.

###Get Flickr!

If you don't already have one you need to get yourself a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) account to upload your project work to this semester. It will get you into the habit of using public creative platforms and provide another area to show off that creative spark.

As mentioned, Richard Weston's [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170) stream is worth checking out. Go to Albums and take a look at [Surface and Object](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157601280958287), [Experimentals](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157630663339086) and [The Ulster Museum](https://www.flickr.com/photos/acejet170/sets/72157623516856557) for a little inspiration.

Week 02 – Harmony and Proportion
--------------------------------

**I do not want to see Instagram used as the final method of delivery and image creation (filters) for your final 12 images.** You can use Instagram as a means to show some experimental material but nothing more.

Material on Henri Cartier-Bresson can be found at:

- [Foundation Henri Cartier-Bresson](http://www.henricartierbresson.org/index_en.htm)
- [Magnum Photos](http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&ERID=24KL53ZMYN)
- [10 Things Henri Cartier-Bresson Can Teach You About Street Photography](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2011/08/22/10-things-henri-cartier-bresson-can-teach-you-about-street-photography)

Everyone is an expert, or so some think. In 2006 Flickr user [André Rabelo][17] submitted Henri Cartier-Bresson's world famous photograph, [Hyeres, France; 1932][18] to the Flickr group pool [Delete Me](http://petapixel.com/2011/07/13/why-you-shouldnt-give-too-much-weight-to-anonymous-online-critics). The group reviews submitted photographs decding whether they are good enough to stay on the site. Cartier-Bresson's timeless classic was deleted very quickly. 

This goes to prove that you shouldn't place too much emphasis on feedback from people who obviously don't know what they are talking about!

We looked also at [Aleksandr Rodchenko](http://aleksandrodchenko.wordpress.com) and the Constructivists last semester but it is always worthwhile reviewing them again. As I have mentioned before,  a solid understanding of design (and art) history will go a long, long way to enrich you as a designer. You can find some of Rodchenko's photographs on [Photoforager](http://www.photoforager.com/archives/alexander-rodchenko).

We looked briefly at James Webb Young's [A Technique for Producing Ideas](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0071410945/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0071410945&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21) last year, it's a very valuable read and costing less than the price of a pint you would be foolish not to get it. 

Webb Young looks at advertising as the focus for idea generation, but the messages can be applied to any creative process and if adhered to will remain with you for life. 

###Preparing images for screen and web

This piece from Six Revisions [The Comprehensive Guide to Saving Images for the Web](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/comprehensive-guide-saving-images-for-web/) will take you through the necessary steps to ensure your images are properly prepared for presentation on the web.

Photoshop isn't the final step in this process. You can use a number of online tools and apps that will reduce your file size further making sure you website is as lean as possible.

Week 03 – Manufactured Fictions in The Age of Instagram
-------------------------------------------------------

>"We shape our tools and there after our tools shape us."

This quote from Marshall McLuan is now more relevant than ever. Mobile technology is everywhere, anyone with a smartphone can become photographers, [journalists,][13] cinematographers, all thanks to the incredible technology we carry with us.

####The Nostalgia of Now

The age of the film camera is more-or-less behind us, with single function, digital cameras, now not far behind. The age of smartphone photography is well and truly here with apps such as [Hipstamatic][2] and [Instagram][3] helping turn the mediocre into the sublime.

[3]:http://instagram.com

With a multitude of filtered effects these apps, and similar others, allow us to make photographs taken today look as if they were shot decades ago. The effects can help create moods and atmospheres, developing personalities and creating a visual brand for individuals and groups. 

Scottish electronic music duo [Boards of Canada][4] use filtered images to evoke memories of hazy summer days. Colours are bleached or saturated, blurred and tinted, giving the impression they were shot decades ago, left in a dusty drawer to gracefully degrade.

Their visual approach matches the music beautifully, snippits of 1970s media are layered with analogue and electronic instruments creating a warm timeless nostalgic wash of sound.

In contrast [Tom Waits][5] has developed a visual persona that matches his gravelly voice and musical themes of degradation and dereliction. [Matt Mahurin's][6] photographs for Waits' [Mule Variations][7] album matches the music beautifully. The sepia-toned grainy images are reminiscent of portraits from the earliest days of photography while videos such as this for [Hold On][8] takes the style into the world of the moving image.

####Beyond the screen

Smartphone photography is finding its way increasingly into mainstream media. [Nick Laham's][9] Instagram iPhone photographs of the [New York Yankees][10] can now be licensed from [Getty Images.][11] 

When on location in Afghanistan, New York Times staff photographer [Damon Winter][12] used his iPhone to capture images of American troops.

>“Composing with the iPhone is more casual and less deliberate, and the soldiers often take photos of each other with their phones, so they were more comfortable than if I had my regular camera.”

The grainy, colour saturated effects added by Hipstamatic's filters bring a reality to the images no DSLR could hope to achieve.

The ability to record moments in time is now easier than ever, we can shoot stills or HD video and instantly share them with friends, family, the rest of the world. While Instagram seeks to reach the masses for the quick gratification of seeing your image liked by complete strangers, other sites such as [Pictory][14] ask us to look a little more closely at, very often, the deeply personal story behind the image.

In preparation for next weeks feedback session review your photographs and reshoot any you feel don't fit the brief. You may use Photoshop or Lightroom or any other preferred photo editing tool to tidy up your images. Do not over do it, these tools should only be used to crop your images if necessary, adjust the exposure, brightness and contrast and if necessary add or remove a little saturation. There are numerous Photoshop tutorials online these [Photoshop essentials][18] may be useful.

If you haven't tried Instagram or Hipstamatic give them a go and post the results on your Design Journal.
