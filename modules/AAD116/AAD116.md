AAD116 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

###Friday Lecture

OK, here we go…

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said **“Study the past if you would define the future.”** Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

So, for **IMD**, as well as keeping a weekly design journal* we would like you to kick off this week with a review of data design genius [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com). We want you to give us a few paragraphs on what he does and your thoughts on his work, you will need to illustrate this with appropriate images. This will live on your webspace on the IMD website and should be kept under a DES106 link. Don’t worry if you can’t build anythng yet, Peter and Gaye will cover the necessary code for this in due course. In the meantime keep your work in a Word (or similar) file, you can upload it to your webspace later.

Don’t forget to check out [Break Conference](http://breakconf.org) and grab yourself a ticket while they’re still available.

*IxD should also keep a weekly journal of their thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects.

The other project for IxD and IMD is the Type Tile project. Over the coming weeks you will choose a period of history and pick out a typeface that particularly appealed to you. You will make up a 3 x 3 grid of these, as the per image below, and present it as part of your final submission.

###Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Atom](https://atom.io) and using the text in the attachment below render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. If you can, print off a copy of what you have created or save it for future reference.

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](http://pixelpaper.org/ixd/week01_markdown.zip) and, using the PDF as a guide reset the markdown_raw.rtf file in Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Atom.




Week 02 – Cave Painting and Illuminated Manuscripts
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

We covered a LOT today with any one aspect worthy of a lecture in itself. But we have a lot more to cover in the coming weeks and rather than go into too much detail on the early history today give us a taste for a number of different areas.


From man’s earliest markings at [Cantabria](http://cuevas.culturadecantabria.com/english/default.htm) the human race has been leaving its mark on the world in many different visual forms. They have been the source of inspiration for designers and artists such as [Picasso][2], writers and movie directors such as [Ridley Scott][3].

[Early writing][4] forms cover millennia of mans history, with many different forms developing throughout the world. Thankfully, as designers, we usually only need to work with one language in our day-to-day routine, but on occasions we will need our work translated onto others. 

The [Golden Ratio][6] is abundant in nature and has been used by architects, artists and designers in the creation of their work for centuries. While not the only way to approach the design of your own work it is certainly a solid, tried-and-tested place to start.

[Tim Brown][7] has created a very useful online [Modular Scale][8] which will help you – once you get to grips with CSS – to develop a well controlled balance to the typography on your Design Journal. Jeremy Church’s [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com) adds a very easy visual dimension to it. What’s more you can grab the CSS from here and add it to your own site.

Make sure to read Christopher Murphy's [Contrast Through Scale][1] on Typecast's blog and add your thoughts in your Design Journal. 

Handwritten books, for many, many years, were the only way society could share and gather knowledge. The privilege of the powerful, religious bodies and the very rich, books were extremely expensive to reproduce restricting the spread of knowledge to those who could afford it.

Books were painstakingly created by [scribes][9], taking many months to complete one book, you can appreciate they were not cheap!

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the [Illuminated Scripts][10] were numbered…

###IMD Group Logo Design

Following today’s brief overview of branding the following resources will help you develop your logo for your group projects.

[Logo Design Love](http://www.logodesignlove.com/logo-design-tips) – is a very useful website with this section particularly appropriate for your current project.

[Pentagram](http://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest) are one of the world's leading brand development consultancies. Take a look at their 'Branding & Identities' and 'Marks' section under the 'All Work' tab.

Books worth checking out (and these should be in the library in Belfast) include:

[Designing Brand Identity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Brand-Identity-Essential-Branding/dp/1118099206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381917117&sr=1-1&keywords=brand+design)

[Marks of Excellence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marks-Excellence-History-Taxonomy-Trademarks/dp/0714864749/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381917585&sr=1-1&keywords=marks+of+excellence)


###Friday IxD Seminar

Great to see everyone (almost) up and running on GitHub. Don't worry if you are still having problems getting your page up, we will get that sorted out next week. Tim's excellent [Hello World][11] tutorial will take you through the process and allow you to start personalising the content. We will look at changing the background next week so don’t worry of you can’t do that now.

Your first project for this module will be to get this page up and ruinning and write profile about you. Nothing huge just a few carefully crafted paragraphs introducing you and your work to the world and including links to relevent external sites (Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc). 

**Before putting pen to paper make sure you research how other designers approach their own self promotion.** Designers worth checking out are:
- [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/about.htm)
- [Craig Mod](http://craigmod.com/about)
- [Sarah Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/about)
- [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer)
- [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/about)

Make sure you research others, don't let the list above be your only source of material.

This, combined with your research and work on the Markdown file last week will equate to 20% of this modules mark. The completion date for this part of your coursework is **Friday 16th October**. Your work should be presented on your GitHub site (we will look at creating additional pages over the next week or two so don’t worry about where everything will go.

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

**The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.**

This weeks lecture looked at the impact of the printing press and its influence on the spread of knowledge in the western world. We also picked out some of the pioneers of type design, looking at how improvements in the printing process helped shape the design of type. 

We also looked broadly at branding with a view to working towards the creation of your company brand design for the group project.



###Typography Today

A solid understanding of and appreciation for type is essential to your development as designers. We will touch on typography frequently this semester and through all of the design modules so learn as much as you can about type. You have been warned!

The following links to online resources and books will get you kicked off.

####Web Typography

Check out Tim Brown's [Nice Web Type][1]

[Typekit][2] is a great way to get started with proper web fonts with lots of choices of good quality type. Unless you are familiar with CSS at this moment wait until that has been covered in your other module. You will be able to use two fonts free of charge on the trial account.

A showcase for Google fonts can be found on [hellohappy.org][4]

The home grown [Typecast][5] is worth taking a look at. 

A List Apart's piece on [Typography & Web Fonts][6] is worth reading. In fact you should keep a regular eye on [A List Apart][7] for articles on all things web related.

[The League of Moveable Type's blog][3] is worth checking out

IMD Project 02 – Typographic History
------------------------------------

**For this weeks project** we want you to choose one typeface from the following list and research the designer, the typeface in question and any other typefaces they may have designed. 

You should illustrate your piece with suitable images both from the original typeface and any contemporary uses you can find.

Although designed, on some occasions, many hundreds of years ago, these typefaces are still in use today and are some of the most popular fonts around. 

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk
