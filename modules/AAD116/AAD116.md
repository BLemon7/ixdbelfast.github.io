AAD116 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

###Friday Lecture

OK, here we go…

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said **“Study the past if you would define the future.”** Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams)hadn't come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

So, for **IMD**, as well as keeping a weekly design journal* we would like you to kick off this week with a review of data design genius [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com). We want you to give us a few paragraphs on what he does and your thoughts on his work, you will need to illustrate this with appropriate images. This will live on your webspace on the IMD website and should be kept under a DES106 link. Don't worry if you can’t build anythng yet, Peter and Gaye will cover the necessary code for this in due course. In the meantime keep your work in a Word (or similar) file, you can upload it to your webspace later.

*IxD should also keep a weekly journal of their thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects.

The other project for IxD and IMD is the Type Tile project. Over the coming weeks you will choose a period of history and pick out a typeface that particularly appealed to you. You will make up a 3 x 3 grid of these, as the per image below, and present it as part of your final submission.

###Friday IxD Seminar

To knck things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with 


Week 02 – Cave Painting and Illuminated Manuscripts
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.

Week 04 – A Century of Change
-----------------------------

The Industrial Revolution of the late 19th and early 20th Century brings massive changes to the way we communicate.

Week 05 – Dada and Propaganda in Design
------------------------------------

Anti-art and war in Europe meets design.


Week 06 – Revolution and the Bauhaus
------------------------------------

The Russian Revolution and The Bauhaus generate visual vocabularies which still influence design today.


Week 07 – WWII, HfG Ulm and Modernism in the US
-----------------------------------------------

World War II forces many of Europes most influential designers to flee to the safety of the US while the Ulm School of Design picks up the pieces in Germany.

Week 08 – Break

Students are encouraged to attend [Break](http://breakconf.org) this week.

Week 09 – The International Style and Swiss Design
--------------------------------------------------

A look at design in post war Europe and beyond.

Week 10 – Postmodernism and the Rise of the Machines
