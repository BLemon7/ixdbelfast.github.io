IXD101 – Interaction Design Fundamentals
========================================

I'll be posting supporting material for IXD101 here. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, don't worry, we will be introducing you to its magic at the end of Week 02.

GitHub can all appear a little intimidating at first, but – like anything in life – with some experience it will all make sense. Don't worry, we won't leave you in the dark, we're here to help and will ensure you're all set to go. For now you can just keep this page bookmarked and read it like any other web page.


Week 01 – The Adventure Ahead
-----------------------------

In this, our first week, we welcomed you to our exciting adventure ahead. Our presentations were as follows:

+ The Adventure Ahead
+ A Show and Tell: Meet Mr Murphy
+ Good Ideas Grow on Paper

Monday's session stressed the importance of working on paper:

> Paper should be the first point of call to get your idea(s) out of your head and into a form that can be easily visualised, reimagined, discussed and shared.
> —Jake Giltsoff, Typekit

> [Always start on paper.](http://www.leemunroe.com/designing-with-pen-paper/)
> —Lee Munroe, Mailgun

> When we jump straight onto the computer and begin pushing pixels around in Photoshop (or our weapon of choice), we’re jumping several stages ahead in the process, without any of the foundational stages that go before it. As a result, we’ll likely find that problems arrive that would’ve been foreseen if we’d only gone through a bit of research and discovery first — some sketching, some loose ideas. The best designs come at the end of a process, and that process begins with rough experimentation with lo-fi tools.
> —Elliot Jay Stocks, Typekit

Next up we had a full day paper prototyping workshop.

Week 02 – Point
---------------

We're starting with the smallest possible building block – the point – we'll use this across a range of exercises on paper that investigate and explore form and composition.

>Point, line, and plane are the building blocks of design. From these elements, designers create images, icons, textures, patterns, diagrams, animations, and typographic systems.” Ellen Lupton

Luptons book [Graphic Design, The New Basics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Graphic-Design-The-New-Basics/dp/1568987021) takes us back to the roots of design and asks designers to take a fresh look at the discipline while Christian Lebourg's [Visual Grammar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Grammar-Design-Briefs-Christian/dp/1568985819/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443441634&sr=8-1&keywords=Visual+Grammar) asks us to learn and understand the basics for a better understanding of the graphics that bombard us every day.

We took a look at [Sagmeister Walsh Seed](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/) branding and how simple dots can become a highly creative and very flexible brand. Alternatively, [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com) shows the value circles add to the creation of his personal annual reports.

####What Do I need?

Continue with your 1,2,3,5 and 50 points and making sure you complete each before moving onto the next. Then create a background for your mobile using nothing but circles. Try to avoid colour, we will be looking at this in good time.

Get a [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) account. It's free and this is where you will post your work for assessment over the coming weeks.

You should also look at setting up a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/tour/0) account. The first 2GB are free and you can earn more space through referrals. Dropbox has become an invaluable tool for dsesigners allowing them to share and access material wherever they are.
