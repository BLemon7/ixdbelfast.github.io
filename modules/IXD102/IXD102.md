IXD102 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

###Friday Lecture

OK, here we go…

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said 

>“Study the past if you would define the future.”

Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

While not an accessible aspect of the course you should try to keep a weekly journal of your thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects. It will show us and potential employers that you are interested and engaged.

###Project 01
Grabbing some lunch, will add content shortly



###Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Brackets](http://brackets.io) and using the text in the attachment below render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. If you can, print off a copy of what you have created or save it for future reference.

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](resources/markdown_raw.rtf) and, using the [PDF](markdown_test.pdf) as a guide set the markdown_raw.rtf file into Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Brackets (or your own preferred text editor).
