##Deliverable 01 - Type Specimen Poster (25%)
Your first project for this module is to create a [Type Specimen Poster](https://uk.pinterest.com/jsgore/typography-type-specimen-posters/) based on **one** of the fonts.

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk

You poster should be A3 (420mm x 297mm) and ideally created in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, alternatively you may use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (students can avail of a 50% discount for this excellent product). If you are not familiar with any of these yet don't panic. You could use (and it pains me to say this) Microsoft Word until you get to grips with the former. 

The poster should be posted to your webspace (IMD) or your GitHub site (IxD) **there is no need to print anything**. Don't worry if you don't have either up and running yet just save what you have until you're ready to upload it.

Research the subject to get a handle on what a type specimen poster should look like (you could even write a little blog post on the subject) before putting **pencil to paper**. Don't just rely on the links we provide, find your own material. As with any creative project **always, always, always** start on paper **never** jump straight onto a computer, you will never create anything meaningful this way.

You poster should obviously feature your chosen font but you should also include a couple of paragraphs on the designer who created the font, give us a little background to who they are and what else they may have created. Don't worry if you don't have access to the fonts, use one that looks closest to it.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.

**Completion Date: Friday 9th October 2015** Rather than take a look through these in Week 04 I will leave the first feedback session until Week 07 when we can look at the first two projects (two posters for IMD and one for IxD (IxD have a group project instead of the second poster)) this will give everyone time to reflect on the first project and improve on things if necessary.

##Deliverable 02 – Design History Poster/Presentation (25%)
Delivery of this particular project will differ for IxD and IMD, the themes for both groups will, however, be the same.

The titles below are relevant to both groups while IMD will create an A3 poster using **one** of the titles below as their these IxD will use the titles to create a ten minute presentation. 

- Bauhaus and the New Typography
- Design Systems for the Olympic Games
- The Influence of Modern Art
- The Modern Movement in America
- Pioneers of Postmodern Graphic Design
- Pioneers of Digital Design

You will find most of the material you need to know from [Meggs' History of Graphic Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0470168730/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) don't worry about rushing out and buying it (it's pretty expensive) the library will have a copy you can work from.

###IMD Poster
As with the Type Specimen poster which you all managed so well, try to design your poster to fit with the period of design you have chosen. Look at this as an exhibition poster promoting a show celebrating the particular period you have chosen.

###IxD Presentation
You should have received an email outlining your groups and the title of your presentation. The presentation should be planned to last 10 minutes and where possible include a presentation element from each member of the team. 

It will be useful to get together in your teams at some stage early next week to discuss who will be responsible for different aspects of the presentation. GitHub is a great way to collaborate on material and keep track of everyone's input it will also allow us to see how each member of the team has performed. This – [How to Collaborate On GitHub](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) is a useful resource on getting up and running with as a group.

###Research, research, research
As with any project research is vital at the early stages (and throughout) to ensure you are going in the right direction and what you are planning to present is relevant and accurate.

###Deadline
IMD poster should be uploaded to your webspace by 9.00am on Friday 30th October so we can take a look through them during the lecture. The IxD presentations will take place on the same day in BA-03-009.

##Deliverable 03 – Design Essay Webpage (50%)
For the final we would like to you write an essay of **no less than 1,500 words** on one of the designers listed below.

Your essay should be well planned and researched before you start writing. Take a look at a few of the designers in question to see which one you wish to cover.

Your final essay should be in the form of a single page website, suitably illustrated with photographs and images of the designers work. You may want to consider designing your essay in the style of the designer chosen, or you may wish to use your own approach. **All** sources should be properly referenced; one of our former IMD students [David Turner](https://davidturner.name/) created this very useful tool [ReferenceIt](https://referenceit.org) to help make the job easier. 

Before taking your essay to the web you should submit it to Turnitin for a quick review of originality. I will run through this process in Week 08.

This project equates to 50% of your final mark for this module. 10% of this will cover use of proper grammar and spelling and another 10% will be given over to the final design.

You should write your essay with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) in the first instance. This will allow you to concentrate on the content at the beginning. Once completed you can convert it to [HTML5](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) and add some CSS3 magic.

To help you get started with your essay structure this PDF will provide a few guidelines – [Essay Writing 101](resources/essay_planning_101.pdf). The content of the PDF is a condensed version of content from the very useful [Skills You Need](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/learn/essay-planning.html) website. This outline [essay plan]()

- Jan Tschichold
- Paul Rand
- Saul Bass
- Massimo Vignelli
- Josef Müller Brockmann
- Neville Brody
- Paula Scher
- Wolfgang Weingart
