IXD303 Deliverables
===================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. There are three deliverables:

+ Deliverable 1 - Portfolio Website / Blog (20%)
+ Deliverable 2 - Elements Website (60%)
+ Deliverable 3 – Research and Discovery (20%)

This module will focus on content in all its forms and will give students a thorough understanding of how to structure and manage content in both a theoretical and practical sense.

Deliverable 1 (20%)
-------------------
The first deliverable is due in **Week 03** with a crit taking place in **Week 04**

###1a. Portfolio Website
In order to be fully prepared for placement opportunities you need to have a strong online portfolio. This should give prospective employers a sense of who you are, your interests, capabilities and aspirations. 

###1b. Blog
It is important you show you are passionate about your chosen career and writing about it is an excellent way to let others see what makes you tick and where your interests lie. We want everyone to include a content managed blog section on their portfolio site.

Deliverable 2 (60%)
------------------

###Elements Website
The [Periodic Table](http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table) as we know, is a table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, so that elements with similar atomic structure appear in vertical columns.

There is an obvious order to this content but, as designers, there is no real reason why we cannot look at this existing order and present alternative arrangements. The results may not be viable, but as designers we sometimes have to question the status quo.

This project will ask you to look at the content of the periodic table from the micro packets of information in each cell on the periodic table to the wider range of content when looking at the details of each element. 

####Project requirements
To cover everything required of this projects you should submit:
- A branded homepage containing your version of the periodic table<sup>*</sup>
- *At least five* additional element pages aimed at the 12–14 year old audience.
- *At least one* element page aimed at undegraduate chemistry sudent.
- A [style guide](http://styleguides.io)

<sup>*</sup>If your version of the Periodic Table is too difficult to create with simple markup and CSS you can present your final design as a static image. You can add individual, linked, elements below for access to the additional pages.

The preferred delivery platform for this project is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
