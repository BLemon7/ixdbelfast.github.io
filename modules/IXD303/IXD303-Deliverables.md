Deliverable 1 (20%)
-------------------
The first deliverable is due in **Week 03** with a crit taking place in **Week 04**

###1a. Portfolio Website
In order to be fully prepared for placement opportunities you need to have a strong online portfolio. This should give prospective employers a sense of who you are, your interests, capabilities and aspirations. 

###1b. Blog
It is important you show you are passionate about your chosen career and writing about it is an excellent way to let others see what makes you tick and where your interests lie. We want everyone to include a content managed blog section on their portfolio site.

Deliverable 2 (60%)
------------------

###Elements Website
The [Periodic Table](http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table) as we know, is a table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, so that elements with similar atomic structure appear in vertical columns.

There is an obvious order to this content but, as designers, there is no real reason why we cannot look at this existing order and present alternative arrangements. The results may not be viable, but as designers we sometimes have to question the status quo.

This project will ask you to look at the content of the periodic table from the micro packets of information in each cell on the periodic table to the wider range of content when looking at the details of each element.

Deliverable 3 (20%)
-------------------

###Research, Discovery and Supporting Sketches
Throughout the module you will be required to maintain a journal, using Tumblr, which maps your research, idea development, sketches, prototypes, etc, for Deliverables 1 & 2.
