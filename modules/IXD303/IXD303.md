IXD303 Designing with Content
=============================

This module explores the importance of considering content – in all its forms – as a core element of any piece of interaction design that can, itself, be designed. As content strategist Karen McGrane puts it: “Well-structured content is the backbone and starting point of all successful web designs and user interactions.” Through an emphasis on developing strategic approaches to content and its generation, students are introduced to additional possible career pathways, including that of the content strategist.

Students undertake a series of exercises, which include: identifying content types and taxonomies; designing content systems; considering future, as yet unimagined content delivery platforms; learning the principles of programming; and exploring Content Management Systems (CMS).

###Week 01: What is Content?   
What exactly is content and why is it important? Who makes content? Who is responsible for content generation? (Equally, who is to blame when content isn’t delivered?).

This module explores the importance of considering content – in all its forms – as a core element of any piece of interaction design that can, itself, be designed.

Through an emphasis on developing strategic approaches to content and its generation, students are introduced to additional possible career pathways, including that of the content strategist.

To start, we are focussing on your own content. Starting with your portfolio sites and extending to social media, we will look at how you create, collect and present content to promote yourselves as effectively as possible.

###Week 01 Task
This week we delved into the [Terminal](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/get-more-out-of-os-x-terminal-3608274) a little to check the version of Ruby installed on oor system then install our own, barebones, static Jekyll site.

If you have managed to get everything installed. Great! If not, don’t fret. There is plenty of help online, these two are a great start.

If you are still wrestling with it drop me a line and I will help you out in the studio next week. If all else fails you can download [this version](resources/portfolio.zip).
