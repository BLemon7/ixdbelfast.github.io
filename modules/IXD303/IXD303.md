IXD303 Designing with Content
=============================

This module explores the importance of considering content – in all its forms – as a core element of any piece of interaction design that can, itself, be designed. As content strategist Karen McGrane puts it: “Well-structured content is the backbone and starting point of all successful web designs and user interactions.” Through an emphasis on developing strategic approaches to content and its generation, students are introduced to additional possible career pathways, including that of the content strategist.

Students undertake a series of exercises, which include: identifying content types and taxonomies; designing content systems; considering future, as yet unimagined content delivery platforms; learning the principles of programming; and exploring Content Management Systems (CMS).

###Week 01: What is Content?   
What exactly is content and why is it important? Who makes content? Who is responsible for content generation? (Equally, who is to blame when content isn’t delivered?).

This module explores the importance of considering content – in all its forms – as a core element of any piece of interaction design that can, itself, be designed.

>"Well structured content is the backbone and starting point for all successful web designs and user interactions."     
<cite>Karen McGrane, Content strategist</cite>

Through an emphasis on developing strategic approaches to content and its generation, students are introduced to additional possible career pathways, including that of the content strategist.

To start, we are focussing on your own content. Starting with your portfolio sites and extending to social media, we will look at how you create, collect and present content to promote yourselves as effectively as possible.

###Week 01 Task
This week we delved into the [Terminal](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/get-more-out-of-os-x-terminal-3608274) a little to check the version of Ruby installed on oor system then install our own, barebones, static Jekyll site.

If you have managed to get everything installed. Great! If not, don’t fret. There is plenty of help online, these two are a great start.

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home)
- [Installing Jekyll](https://github.com/timpotter/installing-jekyll)

If you are still wrestling with it drop me a line and I will help you out in the studio next week. If all else fails you can download [this version](resources/portfolio.zip).

###Week 02 – Lightening the Load

Learning how to properly manage the content on our websites can save you a lot of time and effort when updating, changing or removing that material. 

This is where **includes** come into their own. Includes come in many forms, and can be typically found in PHP and JavaScript. Here, we are focussing on Jekyll, where the terminal install provides us with a default set of **_includes** in our [directory structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure). 

####Includes
The basic set of includes downloaded with the Jekyll install cover everything we need for our `<head>`, `<header>` and `<footer>` content. However, we don’t have to stop here, we can create includes for any type of content that is likely to appear on a regular basis in our websites. Our `<header>` could be split into `<hgroup>` and `<nav>`, we could add a gallery include, includes for social media, or images. If it repeats, it can be, and probably should be, turned into an include.

With this basic structure we can create a **default.html** page which will become the foundation on which we can build the rest of our site.

####Liquid
A look in the **_layouts** folder introduces us to the default page structure where we come across our first introduction to [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) markup. Liquid allows us to pull text content into our pages, where output markup such as – **{{ page.title }}** – pulls in the title specified in our [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) from the page we are currently on. 

Tag markup such as – **{% include head.html %}** – does as you would expect, pulling in the head.html file saved in our includes folder.

####YAML
Our pages are constructed through a combination of Liquid and [YAML](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) front matter. This is where things start to get really interesting. Through a combination of YAML variables and Liquid tags we can build our site in any number of ways.

Setting our front matter at the top of the page as this:–

`---`   
`layout: post  `  
`title:  "Portfolio Preparation"`   
`date:   2016-02-09 14:12:39 +0000`  
`---`

Tells us that our page is going to be built from the post.html structure in our **_layout** folder with the title **Portfolio Preparation** and a date stamp of **Feb 9 2016**. We can additional content automagically through additional Liquid tags and these can be anything we want as long as we reference them properly through YAML and Liquid. 

For example on the front matter above we could add an additional **intro** variable and include the first sentence of our blog post by way of an introduction. Adding **{{ post.intro }}** to our basic **blog.html*** page ensures an intro is included with our list of blog titles.

*Our blog.html page in turn has its own front matter with:–

`---`   
`layout: default`   
`title: Blog`   
`---`

Setting up the build.

Week 03 – Creating and Managing Copy
------------------------------------

What tone and voice do your words possess? What tone are you adopting? What voice are you using? 

When looking at the written word, these are some of the questions we need to ask, to ensure we are targetting our content to the right audience.

Our voice is your personality, your style, your point-of-view. Deliver anything other than that and you can sound false. Your tone is your general attutude; are you witty and sarcastic or serious and formal.

[MailChimp’s](http://mailchimp.com) [Content Style Guide<sup>*</sup>](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone) outlines how they manage their [Voice and Tone<sup>*</sup>](http://voiceandtone.com). Buffer’s [Voice/Tone Guide](https://buffer.com/tone-guide) outlines their approach citing MailChimp along the way.

<small>*Make sure you go through both links.</small>

Once you have your voice and tone in place you need to ensure they remain consistent. Developing a word bank and brand dictionary will help you maintain a uniform delivery much in the way you would expect to do with the visual aspect of your work.

[Huit Denim’s](http://hiutdenim.co.uk/blogs/story) strapline says [‘Do One Thing Well’](http://hiutdenim.co.uk/blogs/story). This is what they live and work by. This is their story. They don’t try to do anything else. They stick to one thing and they do it incredibly well. We can all learn a lot from their story.

Looking at copy for portfolio sites we can learn by example but take heed, don’t copy. You want your tone and voice to come across not a poor imitation of someone else’s.

Week 04 – Structuring Content
-----------------------------

###Taxonomies
Taxonomy is the practice and science of classification of things or concepts and includes the principles that underlie such classification.

So, if we have a group of animals such as:

Frog, Spider, Dog, Elephant, Ant, Newt, Cat, Aardvark, Lion, Bee, Toad, Dolphin, Salmon, Tiger, Blue Whale, Giraffe, Wasp, Trout, Puma, Narwhal, Gorilla, Herring.

We can see where certain groups can be separated to make for easier referencing, recognition and access.

Week 05 – Content Strategies    
----------------------------

>“Content is something we connect to emotionally, converse about or learn from… but content without context is useless.” <cite>[Daniel Eizans](http://danieleizans.com/about/)</cite>

Content, from Eizans’s perspective requires an insight into the users context to ensure the material you are delivering meets the users requirements. This requires that you put yourself in the mind of the end user to determine their physical, emotional and cognitive requirements.

Understanding the context from a [user persona](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/) perspective will help to ensure your content is more finely targetted.

Content strategies, to be successful, require planning for a number of factors – physical, emotional and cognitive:

- Physical Factors:
    - Age
    - Disability
    - Device type
    - Gender
    - Geolocation
    - Time
- Emotional Factors:
    - Marital status
    - Personalisation tools (data mining)
    - Recommendations
    - User feedback
    - Use of social and contextual networking data
- Cognitive Factors:
    - Familiarity with content
    - Education attained
    - Learning disabilities
    - Reading level
    
Online tools such as [Read Able](http://read-able.com) can prove very useful for this last section.

###Good content is user-centered
Thinking about the Elements Project in particular. Ensuring complex content answers the users needs, at their level, is vital if that content delivers specific goals.

Solid research into the target audiences content consumption can help ensure a subject, as complex as the periodic table, is more finely targetted to that particular group.

Week 06 – Adaptive Content
--------------------------

>“Get your content ready to go anywhere because it’s going to go everywhere.”   
<cite>–Brad Frost</cite>

One key method of managing our content from an adaptive perspective is to look at it as a series of chunks which can be used in a number of different ways, for different purposes, and different delivery platforms. 

As we already know, every platform is unique. What works for print won’t necessarily carry over to the web. Mobile  and desktop content require different approaches. User interface design for iOS isn’t the same as Android. With this in mind, we should look at our content from a presentation-independent perspective. This will separate our content from those presentation specific requirements the multitude of devices out there can demand. 

As Karen McGrane puts it:
>“Adaptive content is a way to think beyond the platform. It puts your content at the centre of your strategy and publishing process, right where it belongs. Instead of jumping right to worrying about the requirements and constraints of a particular platform or device, you’re investing in the future of your content.”

###Art Directed Images
One immediate strategy we should be considering is the use of the `<picture>` element. With this we can art direct our images for the best possible presentation across different platform types.

The `<picture>` element isn’t fully supported as yet but browsers are catching up pretty quickly.

- [Working with Images](https://github.com/PixelPaper/working-with-images)
- [Mozilla – `<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)
- [Can I use…](http://caniuse.com/#feat=picture)
- [Responsive Images](https://responsiveimages.org/)

*An art directed image approach should be a definite consideration for your current project.*

###Homework
**Learning how to structure content**

Taking a collection of unstructured content in the form of an element from the [Royal Society of Chemistry](http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table) website. The task is to organise and structure the content across a range of usual platforms – mobile, tablet, desktop. 

The goal is to start to see content in presentation-independent chunks, and getting introduced to the basics of adaptive content. Consider how the content changes across devices and what should and shouldn’t be included between each.

Week 07 - Content Curation 
--------------------------

Curation has a long history in galleries and museums. Curators use judgment and a refined sense of style to select and arrange art to create a narrative, evoke a response, and communicate a message. 

As the digital landscape becomes increasingly complex the techniques and principles of museum curatorship can inform how we create online experiences—particularly when we approach content.

For a long time, we’ve considered digital objects such as articles, slideshows, and video to be transitory items with a very short half-life. However, today, more and more sites can be considered institutions that nurture evergreen assets which they collect, preserve, and attend to. They create themed content packages which, delivered through a variety of means, offer unique perspectives.

The [New York Times](www.nytimes.com/pages/topics/index.html) employ content managers sift through their archives, by grouping articles and resources they are able to create new meaning, giving new life to old material.

Curating content can help you find focus and can help you gain an audience of like minded individuals. As a student this shows potential employers where your level of knowledge.

The type of content you creat will be unique to you and you should think about:

- The type of audience you wish to attract
- The type of content you are interested in
- The type of content you produce
- Delivery platforms

Channels for content curation include your personal blog, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, Pinterest amongst others. Finding and curating content can take a lot of time out of your day but, luckly, there are some useful tools top help make life a little easier.

- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) provides a wealth of methods of automating the gathering  and distribution of content. 

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/my) is a great way to create your own collection of content publishers and organise them by topic. These can then be distributed via your usual delivery methods.

- [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is an excellent tool that lets you create a scheduled list of Tweets which will be delivered when, and as frequently as you need.

Week 08 - Reading Week   
----------------------

Students are expected to continue working on their project material.

Week 09 - Content First Design
------------------------------

>“Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.”
<cite>—Jeffrey Zeldman</cite>

Too often, we start thinking about how or content *will* look, without really thinking about how that content *should* look. We start to consider features and effects before we really consider what our audience really needs. 

Design comes first at the expense of our content.

Starting with the content will allow us to focus primairly on how that content is structured. Stripping the design from the content lets us focus on  how it should be delivered to its intended audience.

Tools such as [Twinery](http://twinery.org/) forces us to focus on the content, allowing us to form and refine structure before considering how it will look.

Making sure your content talks to your audience at the right level is also an important consideration. Online tools such as [Hemingway App](www.hemingwayapp.com/) presents you with a breakdown of sentence structure and readability, level allowing you to refine your content before taking it to the next stage.

When you finally have your content ready and fit for purpose you are able to focus on the design. With the content fully considered, design and copy play off each other, each enriching the other until you don’t consider them separately, but see them as parts of a greater whole.

Week 11 – Designing for Existing and Unknown Future Delivery Platforms 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do you see the future of online communication developing over the next five, ten, 20 years? 

The introduction of the iPhone in June 2007 set the wheels in motion for a sea change in the delivery and consumption of content. As new technologies and products come to the fore, the methods of content delivery, and our consumption of that content, are going to change. 

>We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.
<cite>[Marshall McLuhan](http://www.marshallmcluhan.com/)</cite>

[Wilson Miner](http://wilsonminer.com/) summed up some of McLuhan’s thoughts in his excellent talk for Build Conf – [When We Build](https://vimeo.com/34017777)

Current areas of newer content delivery include:
- The growing crop of smart watches 
    - [Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/uk/watch/)
    - [Samsung Gear S2](http://www.samsung.com/uk/gear-s2/)
    - [Sony SmartWatch 3](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/smartwear/smartwatch-3-swr50/)
